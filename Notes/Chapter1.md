## chapter 1
#### motivation
- What are algorithms?
-  Why is the study of algorithms worthwhile?
-  What is the role of algorithms relative to other technologies used in computers?
### 1.1 Algorithms 
Algorithm
: -     a sequence of computational steps that transform input to output. 
   -     a tool for solving a well-specified computational problem
***The problem*** specifies in geniral the desired input/output relationship.
***The Algorithm*** describes a specific computational procedure for achieving that input/output relationship.
***Instance of a problem*** 
-     Input sequence that consists of Input and Constrains (which imposed in the problem ).   
**Algorithm sort is best !!!** it depends on **Factors**
- the number of items to be stored
- what level the items are already somewhat sorted 
- possible restrictions on the item values
- the architecture of the computer
- storage devices to be used 
   - main memory
   -  disks
   -  tapes

**Algorithm is correct if**  for every input instance,
 it halts with the correct output.  

**An incorrect algorithm** 
: - might not halt at all on some input instances, or it might halt with an incorrect answer.
  -  can sometimes be useful, if we can control their error rate.
  - EX) algorithms for finding large prime numbers.
