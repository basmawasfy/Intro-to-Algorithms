### part I
Chapter 1
: Topics  
- provides an overview of algorithms and  their place in computing systems.
- discuss a case that considers algorithms as a technology alongside technologies such as fast hardware, GUI, object-oriented systems and networks.

Chapter 2
: - includes sorting algorithms like 
**insersion sort** which uses an incremental approach.
**merge sort** which uses recursive technique " divide-and-conquer " .
Although time increases with n in both ,but the rate of increase differs.

Chapter 3
: - explains several aymptotic notations used for bounding algorithm running times. 
  -   presentation of mathematical notation.

chapter 4
: - discuss divide-and-conquer method and algorithms.
  - contains **methods for solving recurrences** which are useful for describing the running times of recursive algorithms.
 like **Master method** which solves recurrences from divide-and-conquer algorithms.

 Chapter 5
 : - introduces probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms
